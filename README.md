This is my project about a museum website. I used SCSS for styling to maintain a modular and scalable CSS structure, alongside BEM methodology to ensure clean and maintainable code. The project features various transformations and animations to enhance user experience, providing a dynamic and engaging interface.

Additionally, I focused on creating a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. The code is organized with reusability in mind, making it easy to extend or modify in the future. I also implemented accessibility best practices to ensure that the site is usable for all visitors.

Overall, this project showcases my ability to combine modern web development techniques with a focus on user experience and maintainable code.
